Dear Udacian,

Great job getting acquainted with the Deep Q Network algorithm and implementing it to successfully solve the Navigation environment. The implementation is pretty good and the agent solves the environment in 433 episodes by achieving an average score of +13.03. The architecture used for the Q network is good in size with two hidden layers of size 64 units each. Good work using relu activation in the network. The implementation is quite good. :smile:

I would suggest you to go through Deep Reinforcement Learning for Self Driving Car by MIT. You'd get to know more about reinforcement learning algorithms in broader and real-world perspective and, more importantly, how to apply these techniques to real-world problems.

All the best for future endeavors. :sparkles:

Training Code
The repository (or zip file) includes functional, well-documented, and organized code for training the agent.

Awesome
Good implementation of the agent for Deep Q Network.
Correct decoupling of the parameters being updated from the ones that are using a target network to produce target values.
Good implementation of The Epsilon-greedy action selection to encourage exploration.
Good use of tau parameter to perform soft-update to prevent variance in the process caused by individual batches.
Good use of the replay memory to store and recall experience tuples.
The code is written in PyTorch and Python 3.

Awesome

Reinforcement learning algorithms are really hard to make work.
But it is substantial to put efforts in reinforcement learning as it is close to Artificial General Intelligence.
This article is a must read: Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn't Work Yet.

The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.

Awesome
Impressive work listing the following concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance:

Double DQN
Dueling DQN
Suggestions
Prioritized Experience Replay should help to improve the performance and significantly reduce the training time also. Using Sum Tree, a special data structure, a fast implementation of PER is possible. It is requested to check this implementation.

It would be very useful to check Improvements in Deep Q Learning: Dueling Double DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, and fixed Q-targets

It is requested to check the following resources to get familiar with the Rainbow algorithm:

Please also check this talk by David Silver, the author of the DQN paper

And, you should definitely try applying these algorithms by taking raw screen pixels as input also. In case you get stuck, definitely check this github repository.
